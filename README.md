# Blocked-Roadmap

**What is this?**

This repository is acting as a list of top-level items for the product roadmap for [ORG's Blocked project](https://blocked.org.uk). The roadmap is available as [a Kanban board here](https://github.com/orgs/openrightsgroup/projects/2).

The roadmap is a forward-looking statement of what we want to do on the Blocked project. Where are we going and whatâ€™s our rough path there?

The content might change and any dates are intended as estimates not fixed delivery dates.

The cards are top-level representations of the product outcomes we want.

- Items we are currently doing are in 'Now'.
- Items we want to do next are in 'Next'.
- Items we will do in the future but not now or next are in 'Later'.
- Items for discussion are in 'For Discussion'.

Lower-level tasks for the project are managed in [this Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/openrightsgroup/projects/1).
