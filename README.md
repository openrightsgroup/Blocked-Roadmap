# Blocked-Roadmap

**What is this?**

This is the product roadmap for [ORG's Blocked project](https://blocked.org.uk).

This is a forward-looking statement of what we want to do on the Blocked project. The content might change and the dates are estimates not fixed delivery dates.

The cards are top-level representations of the product outcomes we want. Where are we going and whatâ€™s our rough path there?

- Items we are currently doing are in 'Now'.
- Items we want to do next are in 'Next'.
- Items we will do in the future but not next are in 'Later'.
